### About Me
<p>
  I'm tech-explorer, always trying to move with the moving technologies.

  A computer engineer, like to work mostly with software, trending technologies.

  More designing ( Not graphics :p ), less coding. :)

</p>

### My work

<p>

  Most of the work is with web or mobile( mostly hybrid). Love to work with
  javascript and Java.

</p>

##### Recent work


  Most recent work was the cordova plugin for voice commands using android.
  Hybrid world had no plugin to handle explicit calls for the application through
  voice commands (__" Ok Google, Find me bla bla "__).

  I was able to complete voice commands to a certain extent in the plugin. Including setting alarms, timers and search in app. You can find the
  source code of the plugin at

  Feel free to use it in your awesome app, improve it and most importantly let me know your awesome work too. :)
