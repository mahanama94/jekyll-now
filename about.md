### About Me
<p>
  I'm tech-explorer, always trying to move with the moving technologies.

  A computer engineer, like to work mostly with software, trending technologies.

  More designing ( Not graphics :p ), less coding. :)

</p>

### My work

<p>

  Most of the work is with web or mobile( mostly hybrid). Love to work with
  javascript and Java.

</p>

##### Recent work


  Most recent work was the cordova plugin for voice commands using android.
  Hybrid world had no plugin to handle explicit calls for the application through
  voice commands (__" Ok Google, Find me bla bla "__).

  During the most recent weeks,
  I've been working on a plugin to handle those events. :) ( Hope it will work :D )
