### About Me
<p>
  I'm tech-explorer, always trying to move with the moving technologies.

  A computer engineer, like to work mostly with software, trending technologies.

  More designing ( Not graphics :p ), less coding. :)

</p>

### My work

<p>

  Most of the work is with web or mobile( mostly hybrid). Love to work with
  javascript and Java. More recently I've been working with databases wchich require high
  avaialability and throughput.

</p>

##### Recent work

  Most recent work was research and the implementation of databases with high availability and throughput as
  a part of my intern work. It helped me to understand a lot of about the internals of the databases and how to fine tune
  them for gaining the best performance. I also work in fields of data mining and machine learning for developing
  applications such as search engines.

  I have added experience and simple guides for you to make your databases and applications in a blog series and most
  of the steps would require less or no changes in your application code. ;)

  I've also worked on a cordova plugin for voice commands using android.
  Hybrid world had no plugin to handle explicit calls for the application through
  voice commands (__" Ok Google, Find me bla bla "__).

  I was able to complete voice commands to a certain extent in the plugin. Including setting alarms, timers and search in app. You can find the
  source code of the plugin at

  Feel free to use it in your awesome app, improve it and most importantly let me know your awesome work too. :)
